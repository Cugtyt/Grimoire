# Grimoire, the book of specs

It become not easy when Kubernetes infra services' specs grow fast,
as they need to be rollout together and to different clusters and namespaces.
The infra services are of anti-microservice pattern and need better way to handle
the specs with complex purposes.

Grimoire will take care Kubernetes resources in programming language way instead of
spec file way to ease the duplicate and complex resources definition in spec files.
